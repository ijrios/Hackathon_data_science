# CardioVigilant AI: Your Heart Health Monitor (Challenges 3)
### Expotecno - Hackathon data science  2023

The Data Science Hackathon is an exciting event designed to satisfy the intense desire of those who, like me, find fascination in exploring innovative ideas and creating technical solutions based on data analysis. This stimulating competition takes place in the context of the prestigious International Energy and Expotech Symposium, bringing together a diverse group of data professionals, engineers, analysts and ardent technology enthusiasts, from all corners of the world.

What really sets this hackathon apart is its technical and rigorous focus on collaboration and shared learning. Participants are grouped into multidisciplinary teams, allowing me to merge my technical data science skills with the specialized knowledge of other experts. Additionally, the event has valuable guidance from experienced mentors who not only raise the bar of skills but also provide critical perspective in solving complex challenges.

In this hackathon, we tackle real-world problems that require a solid understanding of advanced data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques. Participants have the opportunity to work with challenging data sets, explore predictive modeling strategies, and use cutting-edge tools to come up with innovative solutions. In addition, technical issues such as the fusion of data from various sources, algorithm optimization and data quality management are addressed, adding an additional level of complexity and technical depth to the event. In short, the Data Science Hackathon is an exceptional opportunity to elevate our technical skills, collaborate with passionate colleagues, and apply our knowledge in a real and challenging context.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Data Fusion as a Tool for Economic Development Decision-Making

**Context:** Medellin is positioning itself as a tourist destination for short-term stays with certain periodicities as well as for digital nomads with longer stays. These phenomena represent a great opportunity for economic development, but also pose challenges in terms of security, housing, and the cost of living.

**Objective:** The objective of this challenge is to instrumentalize various Open Data sources to create tools that support decision-making by entities (public and/or private) through a Data Fusion approach, to address questions related to Economic Development.

**Data Sources (including but not limited to):**
- Monthly hotel occupancy percentage by zone
- Monthly passenger departures from the airport with international destinations
- Number of users per Wi-Fi zones per site per day
- Monthly income from museum visitors

### Challenge 2: Analysis and Characterization of Public Transportation Dynamics

**Context:** Economic dynamics such as increased gasoline prices and full-day "pico y placa" (license plate restriction) present challenges in terms of mobility to maximize service quality. However, limited resources and inadequate planning have generated congestion and delays, affecting user satisfaction.

**Objective:** The objective of this challenge is to develop an analysis, estimation, or prediction model based on mobility data to determine strategies and dynamics in public transportation on different routes and schedules. The solution may address, but is not limited to, issues such as predicting road incidents or accidents, promoting bicycle usage, congestion reduction strategies, and passenger mobilization analysis.

**Data Sources (including but not limited to):**
- Monthly mobilized passengers on the Medellin Metro
- Monthly mobilized passengers in Medellin
- Road incidents

### Challenge 3: Disease Analysis from Health Data

**Context:** Health is a fundamental aspect of people's lives. Given the amount of information generated from patients, data science can play a crucial role in early identification, prevention, monitoring, and prediction of medically relevant diseases (diabetes, cancer, etc.).

**Objective:** This challenge involves using different data sources to develop analysis, detection, prevention, and/or monitoring models of diseases based on historical patient health data.

**Data Sources (including but not limited to):**
- Etiological factors of renal failure
- Risk of cardiovascular diseases
- Early prediction of diabetes
- Lung cancer detection
- Breast cancer prognosis

### Challenge 4: Data Tools for Supporting the Education System

**Context:** Monitoring and supporting educational institutions are crucial for the successful development of programs. This represents multiple challenges in terms of dropout rates, improving quality, among others. However, this also depends on social, family, and psychological factors of students and the academic community in general.

**Objective:** The goal of this challenge is to use data analysis techniques to predict and estimate student risk factors based on historical data such as grades, academic performance, geographic information, etc. This can help identify students who may be at risk of facing academic difficulties and enable early intervention.

**Data Sources (including but not limited to):**
- Mental health indices in students
- Student performance in exams
- Bullying in schools
- Success/failure indices in students
